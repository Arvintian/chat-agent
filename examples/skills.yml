# Skills Configuration
# Skills are configured in each chat preset using the 'skill' field.
# The skill configuration specifies:
# - dir: Directory containing skills (default: .chat-agent/skills)
# - workDir: Working directory for skill execution
# - timeout: Timeout in seconds for skill operations
# - autoApproval: Whether to auto-approve skill tool usage

# Example skill directory structure:
# .chat-agent/skills/
# ├── git-helper/
# │   ├── SKILL.md
# │   ├── scripts/
# │   └── references/
# └── python-helper/
#     ├── SKILL.md
#     └── references/

# The agent will automatically:
# - Load skill metadata at startup
# - Register skill tools (list-skills, view-skill)
# - Make skill content available when needed
# - Allow tools to interact with skills
